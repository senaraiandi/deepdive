# DeepDive

### Overview

DeepDive helps scientists and developers solve complex inference problems. This is generally done in two steps: Feature Extraction and Probabilistic Inference. During feature extraction, user to write feature extractors that operate on JSON input and produce JSON output. These feature extractors can be written in any language, such as Python. For probabilistic inference, DeepDive exposts a language similar to Markov Logic. Using this language, users declare "rules" which are used to construct a factor graph. DeepDive then performs efficient weight learning and probabilistic inference on the factor graph. A common use case for DeepDive is KBC (knowledge-base construction).
