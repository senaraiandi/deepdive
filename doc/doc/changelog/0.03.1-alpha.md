# Changelog for version 0.0.3.1-alpha (08/15/2014)

- Add support and documentation for [multinomial variables and multinomial
  factor function](../basics/multinomial.html).
- Add [text chunking example](../basics/chunking.html) to show how to use
  multinomial random variables.
- Add support for array type variables.
- Add support for [parallel factor graph
  grounding](../advanced/performance.html#grounding).
- Update [grounding](../basics/overview.html#grounding): all grounding/dumping
  is now done in the database instead of having data going through Scala code.
- Add a data unloader utility.

<!-- TODO (Feiran) Where is it, what does it do? -->
