# Changelog for Release 0.7.0-alpha (07/13/2015)

* Provides a new command-line interface `deepdive` with a new [standard DeepDive application layout](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/doc/advanced/deepdiveapp.html).
  - No more installation/configuration complication: Users run everything through the only `deepdive` command, and everything *just works* in any environment.  The only possible failure mode is not being able to run `deepdive` command, e.g., by not setting up the `PATH` environment correctly.
  - No more pathname/environment clutter in apps: repeated settings for `DEEPDIVE_HOME`, `APP_HOME`, `PYTHONPATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, ... in run.sh or env.sh or env_local.sh or env_db.sh or etc. are gone.  Path names (e.g., extractor udf) in application.conf are all relative to the application root, and brittle relative paths are no longer used in any of the examples.
  - Clear separation of app code from infrastructure code, as well as source code from object code: No more confusing of deepdive source tree with binary/executable/shared-library distribution or temporary/log/output directories.
  - Binary releases can be built with `make package`.

* Here are a summary of changes visible to users:
  - Application settings is now kept in `deepdive.conf` file instead of `application.conf`.
  - Database settings is now done by putting everything (host, port, user, password, database name) into a single URL in file `db.url`.
  - Path names (e.g., extractor udf) in deepdive.conf are all relative to the application root unless they are absolute paths.
  - SQL queries against the database can be run easily with `deepdive sql` command when run under an application.
  - Database schema is now put in file `schema.sql` and optional initial data loading can be done by a script `input/init.sh`.  Input data is recommended to be kept under `input/`.
  - By passing the pipeline name as an extra argument to the `deepdive run` command, different pipelines can be run very easily: No more application.conf editing.
  - Logs and outputs are placed under application root, under `snapshot/`.

* Adds Dashboard GUI (Mindbender) for producing summary reports after each DeepDive run.

* Extends DDLog syntax to support writing more real world applications.

* Adds [piggy extractor](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/doc/basics/extractors.html#piggy_extractor) that replaces the now deprecated plpy extractor.
