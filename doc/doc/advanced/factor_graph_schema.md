# Factor Graph Grounding Output Schema Reference

[Grounding](../basics/overview.html#grounding) is the process of building the
factor graph and dumping it to files that the [sampler](../basics/sampler.html)
can take as input. DeepDive uses a custom binary format to encode the factor
graph. It generates four files, one each for weights, variables, factors, and
edges. All files resides in the `out/` directory of the latest run. The format
of these files is as follows, where numbers are in bytes and **network byte
order** is used.

Weights

    weightId        long    8
    isFixed         bool    1
    initialValue    double  8


Variables

    variableId      long    8
    isEvidence      bool    1
    initialValue    double  8
    dataType        short   2
    edgeCount*      long    8
    cardinality     long    8

Factors

    factorId        long    8
    weightId        long    8
    factorFunction  short   2
    edgeCount       long    8

Edges

    variableId      long    8
    factorId        long    8
    position        long    8
    isPositive      bool    1
    equalPredicate  long    8


*Note*: from [version 0.03](../changelog/0.03-alpha.html), the edgeCount field
in Variables is always -1.

The systems also generates a metadata file which contains a single line in
comma-separated-values format with the following fields:

    Number of weights
    Number of variables
    Number of factors
    Number of edges
    Path to weights file
    Path to variables file
    Path to factors file
    Path to edges file
