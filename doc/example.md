# Overview

To illustrate a more concrete application of DeepDive, we provide a simple entity-linking example, located in examples/kbp. This example comes from the [KBP entity linking competition](http://www.nist.gov/tac/2013/KBP/EntityLinking/). The objective is to extract mentions labeled PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and GPE, and to link these mentions to entities with the same labels. In the example, we provide a partial Freebase dump file for entity extraction, and a set of Newswire press releases for mention extraction.
